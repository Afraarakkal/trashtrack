## **📌 Project Overview**  

### **🔹 Problem Statement**  
Sorting waste manually is inefficient and often leads to improper disposal. Many people struggle to determine whether an item is biodegradable or not, which contributes to pollution and waste mismanagement.  

### **🔹 Solution**  
TrashTrack leverages AI to automate waste classification. Users can upload an image, and the model will instantly classify the object as **biodegradable** or **non-biodegradable**. This solution promotes waste segregation, making the process smarter, quicker, and eco-friendly.
