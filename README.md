*Project Description*
This AI-based waste classifier identifies whether an object is biodegradable or non-biodegradable using an image classification model. It helps promote waste segregation and environmental awareness.

---

*The Problem Statement*
Sorting waste manually is inefficient and often leads to improper disposal. People struggle to determine which items are biodegradable and which are not, leading to increased pollution and waste mismanagement.

*The Solution*
We use AI to automate waste classification! Just upload an image of the object, and our model will instantly tell you whether it's biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Itâ€™s smart, quick, and eco-friendly!
